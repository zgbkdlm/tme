Installation
============

You can install :code:`tme` by either :code:`pip` or :code:`setup.py`.

If you want to use JaX TME
--------------------------
Please note that :code:`jax` is **not** included in the requirement list, because we would like 
the user themself to manually install `jax`. For the installation of `jax`, see, `this link <https://github.com/google/jax#installation>`_.

If you just want to use SymPy TME, you can ignore installing JaX.

By :code:`setup.py`
-------------------
