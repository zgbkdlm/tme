TME in Matlab
=============

Docing Matlab codes takes a bit of efforts. We refer the user to the docstrings in .mat files for details.

In folder :code:`matlab`, you can find

1. folder :code:`+models` containing some example models;

2. folder :code:`+tools` containing the implementations of TME as well as some tool functions. 

The file :code:`TME.m` is the main file of TME in Matlab.
