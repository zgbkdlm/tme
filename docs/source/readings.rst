The TME method is due to Dacunha-Castelle and Florens-Zmirou (1986); Florens-Zmirou (1989), where they use it to estimate diffusion processes coefficients. 

It is also shown by Zhao et al. (2020) and Zhao (2021) that TME can be used in Gaussian filtering and smoothering, as well as deep GP regression problems.

The implementations and math in the docstrings are based on Zhao (2021).
